A) On running the code it was observed that keeping the value of parameter k as odd, the results were much more accurate as  compared to that of taking k as even.
 It is advisible to take odd values for binary classification to avoid the ties i.e. two classes labels achieving the same  score.

B)Drwabacks of knn
1)Large search problem to find nearest neighbours
2)Storage of data
3)Must know we have a meaningful distance function
4)Need to determine value of parameter k(no. of nearest neighbours). 


C)Recall and precision
Recall can be defined as the ratio of no. of events a person can correctly recall to all correct all events.
Precision can be defined as ratio of events you can correctly recall (events that your machine correctly predicts) to a number of all events you can recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls)
An F score is defined which is the harmonic mean of recall(R) and precision(P).
Mathematically,
						F=2PR/(P+R)
